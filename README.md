# Lightning DEX

This DEX allows atomic swaps between EVM chains and Lightning.

Support for Bitcoin layer 1 will be added later since it's slightly more complex. 

This repo is under development and more info will be added soon. 

Until then check out the `contracts` folder for the implementation and the `test` folder for examples.
