You need to edit the .env file to set the correct values for the following variables:
GRPC_HOST, SSL_PATH , MACAROON_PATH  in the lnd_scripts/grpcConnection.js for your own lnd node

this starts up a local devnet (you need foundry installed):
anvil -a 3


This will deploy the contracts to the local devnet and give the exchange and the user each 500 * 10^18 tokens:
sh ./deploy_contracts.sh


starts the node server:
node backend/server.js


There are two tests in the lnd_scripts/tests/test_user.js that you can try one for btc->eth and one for eth->btc
There needs to be a channel open between the user and exchange funded sufficiently for this to work.
